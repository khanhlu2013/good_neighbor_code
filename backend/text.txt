. LOW PRIORITY INVENTORY
. ----------------------
  . upgrade api to support multiple spa web app
  . upgrade api to support mobile app. (fow now api only work with browser)
    . what is it mean for a mobile app to receive a cookie from a successful login response
  . figure out how to use a post request for sign up and log out. did andrew mead use post?
  . also understand get/post for good
  . search by name with pagination/connection? damn
  . think about the auth flow. If i just logout, i do not need to check if i am login. also i should know locally from cookie that i am not login.
  . firgure out how to make the api agnostic to the front client url. any one can write a SPA app, host it somewhere, login to goodneighboor api and get redirect there. learn about the uri callback. seem like there is multiple. uri.
  . how to replace manual await for Model.init() with a middle ware. what is the best practice for production?
  . can composite key be utilize for a single column? or is it just the first key, and not the second key

. INVENTORY
. ---------
  . if there is no internet, i need to response better.
  . notification page
  . write some test for the home/profile/auth route
  . display list of your friend + remove friend
  . add picture to profile
  . on the front end, i need to somehow extract out all the const, including url and param expected such as addFriend : IdToAdd
  . truely understand mongo, and how to fix the array duplicate issue that a user can't have duplicated friend
  . seem like when the user db is empty, the get profile return error
  . get prettier into code studio
  . change connection into connection-model.js
  . allow inviter to revoke friend after invited-person approved.
  . think about profile -> connection organization to split up code
  . clean up async handler from express and create a error handler middleware
  . rename add to invite
  . friends page:
    how can i use existing feature on searchByEmail and manage this table?
  . how can i test the frontend login page and the back end auth-api route? do i leave this alone?
  . before each for e2e take a long time. invest do a script here
  . provide spinner every where pending for response
  . investigate props type
  . handle frontend error: lets say somehow the session terminated. and a user access API and get 401. i do not want to display a unhandle project rejection.
  . make e2e test more stayble by narrow down the snapshot area
  . allow multiple post image with the main image as the thumbnail
  . eliminate default import for both backend and frontend. test auto import for backend.
  . see if we can eliminate refreshConnectionsCb. if we don't differentiate between create/modify and just have a crudConnection, then we don't need to refresh it inside searchEmail because searchEmail just simply call crud for create and the parent management component will refresh it without needing to pass the cb in the child component
  . should i factor out a lib to get posts, connections ...
  . create error handling for the front end to be more detail: internet or server bug
  . shareLog, create and update failure should be unit tested and not e2e tested.
  . work on deployment. and provide a make-sense mvp for auth. 
  . when i login, i need to make it a post because if it is a get, i will be able to go back into history which is a undesireable behavior
  . fuck: change post into user. shareLog to have from and to; or consider borrower and lender. but from and to do share many time. and well understood from many context. 
  . for share, isReturnByTo can't be true if isApprovedByFrom is undefined or false. i need this validation
 . renaming share.borrower
 . create a model for connection for the frontend
 . color coded available post , and current borrowing post
. how do i know a post have picture or not?
. test when connection change, InPost will be changing. this will be affecting current borrowing. think about mvp
. Using Immutable Data Structures: https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#the-power-of-not-mutating-data
. https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/
. post: { ...state.post, isActive }, immutable.js seem can aleviate this boilerplate

. TODAY
. -----
. the key-values.json file need to be duplicate on the frontend and backend. where the app will read the NODE_ENV and decide what value to use. i can think a step further to build this file automatically from a root folder of backend and frontend. these value only need for dev/test purpose. 
. express-session deprecated undefined resave option; provide resave option
. also notice a possible improvement is that the frontend port (for test/dev) use a hard code 3002. this 3002 number is hardcode twice in the .env from react-app and the backend key-for-test-dev.js. is it possible to factor this out too the root too?
. just accept that test env use backend port 3001 and dev use 3000. then i will see how i can factor this number out into the root folder project

-----
. change inPost, outPost into myPost and friendPost: developing experience is higher with higher level language
. remove the ability to undo an invite, less button, less confusion? friendly, less option. ok.
. kill event.currentTarget?
